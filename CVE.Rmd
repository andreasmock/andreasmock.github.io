### Cancer Variant Explorer (CVE)

In my Master thesis in Computational Biology at the Cancer Research UK Institute, Cambridge with Charlie Massie and Nitzan Rosenfeld, I set out to develop an interactive variant prioritisation tool for precision cancer medicine. The result was the Cancer Variant Explorer (CVE), an R package that uses the Shiny framework to interactively explore and prioritize variants.
