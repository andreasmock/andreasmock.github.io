###`About me`

I am an [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) enthusiast and intrigued by the prospects of data science for omics-guided Precision Oncology. My research has been concerned with the identification of molecular patterns predictive of therapy response using high-throughput characterizations of cancer on multiple levels of biology ("multi-omics").
