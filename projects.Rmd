### Medical Informatics

Healthcare is one of the last sectors of public life that is not digitalized to a major extent. The lack of powerful hospital IT infrastructures is not only constraining productivity of healthcare employees, but also poses a major bottleneck for data-hungry biomedical research and the pursuit for precision oncology. To this end, I am developing physician-centered software solutions.
